# Demos

Demos using UDP/ZMQ to communicate with a serial adapter (using KISS protocol).

Demos are in C++ (ZMQ), Node.js (ZMQ) and Python (UDP).

The wire protocol used by C++ and Node.js implemenetations is not compatible with the Python protocol.

The C++ and Node.js implementations are compatible and can talk to each other.
