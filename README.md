# Demos

Demos using ZMQ to communicate with a serial adapter (using KISS protocol).

Demos are in C++17, Node.js, and Python 3.6+, and the different implementations can talk to each other.

The "bridge" which they use to talk through the serial link is only implemented in C++ currently.

The "old" demos in python/old/ can talk to each other but are not compatible with the new demos.
